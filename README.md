Product Description: 

TourNotes is a web application for millennials, adventurers and all music enthusiasts ready to match road trip thrills with their favorite soundtracks. It all begins with an immersive planning experience as users design a trip ready to ooze with head banging (or sultry swaying) nostalgia. Pick the dates you can travel, all your must-sees along the way or live by the glory of our Random Button. Find whoâ€™s playing in the area and for those new finds, screen their Spotify discography for playlist eligibility. Allow serendipity to color the edges of your next adventure with TourNotes.
