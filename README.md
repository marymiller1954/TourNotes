Product Description: 

TourNotes is a web application for millennials, adventurers and all music enthusiasts ready to match road trip thrills with their favorite soundtracks. It all begins with an immersive planning experience as users design a trip ready to ooze with head banging (or sultry swaying) nostalgia. Pick the dates you can travel, all your must-sees along the way or live by the glory of our Random Button. Find who’s playing in the area and for those new finds, screen their Spotify discography for playlist eligibility. Allow serendipity to color the edges of your next adventure with TourNotes.
